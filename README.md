# Flutter Vancouver

**This is archived and we then had two iterations of the Flutter Vancouver website. The next iteration is open sourced and available for everyone and the current iteration isn't open sourced as I need to extract the third party resources and also need to make it configuration based. If you need additional information, please reach out!**

This is the landing page for the Flutter Vancouver Group. The website uses the [bootstrap starter framework](https://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/scrolling-nav/)
